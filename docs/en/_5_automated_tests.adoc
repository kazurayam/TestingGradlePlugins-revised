== Setting up automated tests

=== Organizing directories for sources

The plugin development project is named `url-verifier-plugin`. It has 4 sub-directories: `src/main/java`, `src/test/groovy`, `src/integrationTest/groovy` and `src/functionalTest/groovy`. These directories form 4 source sets.

The `src/main/` contains the source of our custom plugin, written in Java.

We have 3 distinguished directories for automated tests.

The `src/test/` contains the unit-tests against the code in the `src/main/java`.

The `src/integrationTest/` contains the integration tests against the classes/methods in the `src/main/java` involving access to external resources such as web resources connected as `http://` or DB.

The `src/functionalTest/` contains the functional tests against the custom plugin developed in the `src/main/`. It generates a temporary `build.gradle` file which uses the target custom plugin. The functional tests execute the temporary `build.gradle` immediately and check how the plugin works.

=== Configuring source sets and tasks

Gradle's "Source sets" gives us a powerful way to structure source code in our Gradle projects. You can learn more about Source sets at link:https://www.baeldung.com/gradle-source-sets["Gradle Source Sets", Baeldung]

The `url-verifier-plugin` project uses the `groovy` plugin and `java-gradle-plugin`.

The `groovy` plugin implicitly creates 2 Source sets: `main` and `test`.

The `main` source set is configured to point the `url-verifier-plugin/src/main/` directory for source codes, which would include the plugin class and its various associated classes.

The `test` source set is configured to point the `url-verifier-plugin/src/test/` directory for source codes, which would include classes that perform unit-tests over the classes in the `main` source set.

Now we want to create 2 more source sets: `integrationTest` and `functionalTest`. The following fragment create these 2 source sets, and add custom tasks named `integrationTest` and `functionalTest`.
