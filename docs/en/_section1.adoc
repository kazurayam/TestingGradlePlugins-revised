== section 1



You can download the ZIP file of this repository at the following URL:

- https://github.com/kazurayam/TestingGradlePlugin-revised/releases/

The original was the following document published by the Gradle project:

- https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/testing_gradle_plugins.html

I read this and got surprised to find how the document is poorly written. It does not provide a distributable archive of working sample code set, with which I can quickly try running the software. Why not? I also found that the explanation of the article is incomplete. The document does not show the code of a few files which are essential to make the software runnable.

I have spent a few days struggling to create a Gradle project which is ready to run and presents a full code set for the article shown above.
