== The sample Gradle project that consumes custom plugin

Let's have a look at the code in the consumer project `include-plugin-build`. It has only 2 files.

image:file.png[] `include-plugin-build/setting.gradle`
[source,groovy]
----
include::../../include-plugin-build/settings.gradle[]
----

image:file.png[] `include-plugin-build/build.gradle`
[source,groovy]
----
include::../../include-plugin-build/build.gradle[]

The following Console interaction demonstrates how to run a task `verifyUrl` which calls the custom plugin `org.myorg.url-verifier` :
