== Sample Gradle project that consumes custom plugin

The following Console interaction demonstrates how to run a task `verifyUrl` which calls the custom plugin `org.myorg.url-verifier` :

$ basename `pwd`
TestingGradlePlugins-revised
$ cd include-plugin-build/
$ ./gradlew verifyUrl

> Task :verifyUrl
Successfully resolved URL 'https://www.google.com/'

Let's have a look at the code in the consumer project `include-plugin-build`. It has only 2 files.

image:file.png[] `include-plugin-build/build.gradle`
[source,groovy]
----
include::../../include-plugin-build/build.gradle[]
----

The `buildscript {}` closure here declares that this build script depends on the class library `org.myorg:url-verifier-plugin`. And the `apply plugin` imports the custom Gradle plugin of id `org.myorg.url-verifier`. The `verifycation { url = '...''` closure is specifying the value for the `url` parameter of the plugin's implementing class.

include::../../include-plugin-build/settings.gradle[]

I must confess, I do not understand the terms here: `includeBuild`, `dependencySubstitution`, `substitute` and `module`.


=== Alternative way

I could publish the custom Gradle plugin `org.myorg.url-verifier` to the mavenLocalRepository. How to?

image:file.png[] `url-verifier-plugin/build.gradle`
[source,groovy]
----
include::../../url-verifier-plugin/build.gradle[lines=1..12]
----

and I execute the following command:

----
$ basename $(pwd)
url-verifier-plugin
$ ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
----

then I got the plugin's jar file saved:

----
$ pwd
/Users/kazurayam/.m2/repository/org/myorg/url-verifier-plugin/1.2
$ ls -la
total 32
drwxr-xr-x  5 kazurayam  staff   160  6 22 11:03 .
drwxr-xr-x  7 kazurayam  staff   224  6 22 11:03 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 kazurayam  staff  5840  6 22 11:03 url-verifier-plugin-1.2.jar
-rw-r--r--  1 kazurayam  staff  1916  6 22 11:03 url-verifier-plugin-1.2.module
-rw-r--r--  1 kazurayam  staff   757  6 22 11:03 url-verifier-plugin-1.2.pom
----

Once the plugin's jar is published in the mavenLocal repository, the following configuration also worked.

image:file.png[] `include-plugin-build/build.gradle`
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.myorg:url-verifier-plugin:1.2'
    }
}
apply plugin: 'org.myorg.url-verifier'

verification {
    url = 'https://www.google.com/'
}
----

image:file.png[] `include-plugin-build/settings.gradle`
----
/* I do not use includeBuild */
----

This way worked. But I wasn't fully contented with it. Why? I found 2 issues here.

1. I have to repeat running `publishToMavenLocal` task
2. The plugin's version number `1.2` is repeated in 2 build.gradle file

I would definitely repeat changing the plugin and testing it. I do not like to repeat running `publishToMavenLocal` task, I do not like to repeat coding the version number at multiple places.
