## What is this

This article is based on the following article published by the Gradle project:

-   [Testing Gradle plugins](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/testing_gradle_plugins.html)

One day I read the original and found a few points that I can improve. Especially, I wanted an archive of sample codes that works. I struggled for a few days creating it and got a success. So I am going to present the zip file I created attached with my explanation how to test custom Gradle plugins.

## How to useðŸ‘£

Visit [the top page](https://github.com/kazurayam/TestingGradlePlugins) of this repository, and click on the ![Use this template](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Use%20this%20template-brightgreen). Then you can clone this as template to create your own.

Or you can visit [the Releases page](https://github.com/kazurayam/TestingGradlePlugins-revised/releases/) and download the zip archive. Just download and unzip it.
