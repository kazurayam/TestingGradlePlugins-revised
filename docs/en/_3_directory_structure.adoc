The root directory `TestingGradlePlugins-revised` is mapped to the Git repository at https://github.com/kazurayam/TestingGradlePlugins-revised. Therefore I can keep these 2 Gradle projects version-controlled by Git in sync.

The `url-verifier-plugin` project develops a custom Gradle plugin. The `url-verifier-plugin` project is self-contained, is independent on the `include-plugin-build` project at all.

The `include-plugin-build` project consumes the custom Gradle plugin which is developed by the `url-veirifer-plugin` project.

=== Gradle's terminology "Composite build"

There is a Gradle term _Composite builds_. The `include-plugin-build` project is a concrete example of "Composite builds", and it is working fine --- I am happy about it.

By Googling you can find several resources to learn what _Composite build_ is, how to make it, how to utilize it. I had a look at these resources. For example:

- https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html

But I must confess that I do not really understand _Composite builds_ yet.
