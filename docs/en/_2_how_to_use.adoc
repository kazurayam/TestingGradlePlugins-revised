== How to useðŸ‘£

=== Prerequisites

1. It is assumed that you have Java8 or newer installed
2. I tested the artifacts using Gradle v7.4.2 on macOS v12.4

=== How to get the sample project

Visit link:https://github.com/kazurayam/TestingGradlePlugins[the top page] of this repository, and click on the image:https://img.shields.io/badge/-Use%20this%20template-brightgreen[Use this template]. Then you can clone this as template to create your own.

Or you can visit link:https://github.com/kazurayam/TestingGradlePlugins-revised/releases/[the Releases page] and download the latest "Source code" archive. Just download and un-archive it.

=== How to run the automated tests

You can perform automated-test for the sample custom plugin; do like this:

image:console.png[]
----
$ basename $(pwd)
TestingGradlePlugins-revised
$ cd url-verifier-plugin
$ ./gradlew clean check

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 22s
12 actionable tasks: 12 executed
----

When you run the `:check` task, other tasks `:test`, `:intergrationTest` and `:functionalTest` will effectively executed. These 3 tasks implements automated tests for the sample custom Gradle plugin `org.myorg.url-verifier`.


And one more scenario.

image:console.png[]
----
$ cd ../include-plugin-build
$ ./gradlew verifyUrl

> Task :verifyUrl
Successfully resolved URL 'https://www.google.com/'

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
5 actionable tasks: 2 executed, 3 up-to-date
----

The `:verifyUrl` task, which is defined in the `include-plugin-build/build.gradle` file, runs a custom Gradle plugin `org.myorg.url-verifier` developed by the `url-verify-plugin` project and asserts the plugin's outcomes.
