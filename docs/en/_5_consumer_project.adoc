== Sample Gradle project that consumes custom plugin

The following Console interaction demonstrates how to run a task `verifyUrl` which calls the custom plugin `org.myorg.url-verifier` :

$ basename `pwd`
TestingGradlePlugins-revised
$ cd include-plugin-build/
$ ./gradlew verifyUrl

> Task :verifyUrl
Successfully resolved URL 'https://www.google.com/'

Let's have a look at the code in the consumer project `include-plugin-build`. It has only 2 files.

[source,groovy]

include::../../include-plugin-build/build.gradle[]

The `buildscript {}` closure here declares that this build script depends on the class library `org.myorg:url-verifier-plugin`. And the `apply plugin` imports the custom Gradle plugin of id `org.myorg.url-verifier`. The `verifycation { url = '...''` closure is specifying the value for the `url` parameter of the plugin's implementing class.

I must confess, I do not understand the terms here: `includeBuild`, `dependencySubstitution`, `substitute` and `module`. I learned them in another article link:https://ncorti.com/blog/gradle-plugins-and-composite-builds["Gradle Plugins and CompositeBuilds" by Nicola Corti]. I copy&pasted it and tried. It happened to work.
