== How I revised the original

This project of mine is based entirely on the Gradle project's documentation:

- link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/testing_gradle_plugins.html[`Testing Gradle plugins`]

I will call this article as "the original". My sample code set has some differences from the original. Let me enumerate the differences and add some explanations.

=== How to construct Composite projects

The original proposes a way how the consumer project is associated with the plugin development project, as follows:

image:file.png[] `include-plugin-build/build.gradle`
----
plugins {
    id 'org.myorg.url-verifier'
}
----

image:file.png[] `include-plugin-build/settings.gradle`
----
pluginManagement {
    includeBuild '../url-verifier-plugin'
}
----

This didn't work for me. link:https://github.com/kazurayam/TestingGradlePlugins-revised/issues/1[When I ran it], I got the following error:

----
$ basename $(pwd)
include-plugin-build
$ gradle verifyUrl

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* Where:
Build file '/Users/kazuakiurayama/tmp/url-verifier-gradle-plugin/include-plugin-build/build.gradle' line: 2

* What went wrong:
Plugin [id: 'org.myorg.url-verifier'] was not found in any of the following sources:

- Gradle Core Plugins (plugin is not in 'org.gradle' namespace)
- Included Builds (None of the included builds contain this plugin)
- Plugin Repositories (plugin dependency must include a version number for this source)
...
----

So I revised this part as follows:

image:file.png[] `include-plugin-build/build.gradle`
----
include::../../include-plugin-build/build.gradle[]
----

image:file.png[] `include-plugin-build/settings.gradle`
----
include::../../include-plugin-build/settings.gradle[]
----

I learned this from an article
link:https://ncorti.com/blog/gradle-plugins-and-composite-builds[Gradle plugins and Composite builds] by ncorti.



=== integrationTest depends on classes in the main source set

I added the following line:

image:file.png[] `url-verifier-plugin/build.gradle`
----
include::../../url-verifier-plugin/build.gradle[lines=50..53]
----

This single line makes the classes in the `main source set available for the test class in the `integrationTest` source set. Without this, the integrationTest does not compile:

----
$ basename $(pwd)
url-verifier-plugin
$ ./gradlew integrationTest

> Task :compileIntegrationTestGroovy
startup failed:
/Users/kazuakiurayama/github/TestingGradlePlugins-revised/url-verifier-plugin/src/integrationTest/groovy/org/myorg/http/DefaultHttpCallerIntegrationTest.groovy: 11: unable to resolve class HttpCaller
 @ line 11, column 5.
       @Subject HttpCaller httpCaller = new DefaultHttpCaller()
       ^

/Users/kazuakiurayama/github/TestingGradlePlugins-revised/url-verifier-plugin/src/integrationTest/groovy/org/myorg/http/DefaultHttpCallerIntegrationTest.groovy: 11: unable to resolve class DefaultHttpCaller
 @ line 11, column 38.
       @Subject HttpCaller httpCaller = new DefaultHttpCaller()
                                        ^

2 errors


> Task :compileIntegrationTestGroovy FAILED

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':compileIntegrationTestGroovy'.
> Compilation failed; see the compiler error output for details.
----

The original wrote this as:
----
    integrationTestImplementation(project)
----

But I prefer writing `sourceSets.main.output` here instead of `project` to be more explicit.

=== Added java codes as example

The original misses some of the sources of Java classes.

So I guessed how the missing codes should be. I added them in the sample project.
